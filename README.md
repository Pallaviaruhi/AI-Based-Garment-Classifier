# Fashion Forward - AI-Based Garment Classifier

## Overview

Fashion Forward is an AI-powered e-commerce clothing retailer that uses machine learning to categorize new product listings automatically. This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of clothing items into distinct categories such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc. This classification helps customers find what they are looking for more easily and streamlines inventory management.

## Project Objectives

- Build a deep learning model to categorize garment images.
- Train the model to improve accuracy and precision.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Model Architecture

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify clothing items. The model consists of:

### 1. Convolutional Layers:

- Extract features from input images using filters.
- Enhance important patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.

### 2. Rectified Linear Units (ReLU):

- Introduce non-linearity to help the model learn complex patterns.

### 3. Pooling Layers:

- Reduce the spatial size of feature maps while retaining important information.

### 4. Fully Connected Layers:

- Flatten the feature maps and pass them through dense layers to make predictions.

### 5. Forward Pass:

- A method to pass a batch of images through the model to get predictions.

## Training the CNN

The model is trained using the following steps:

### 1. Defining the Loss Function:

- We use **CrossEntropyLoss** as the loss function to measure prediction errors.

### 2. Defining the Optimizer:

- **Adam optimizer** is used to update model weights efficiently during training.

### 3. Training Loop:

- The dataset is passed through the model in multiple iterations (epochs).
- Loss is computed and backpropagated to update model parameters.
- The model continuously learns from the dataset and improves accuracy.

## Testing the CNN

After training, the model is tested using a separate dataset to measure its performance.

### 1. Predicting Categories:

- The trained model classifies images into appropriate clothing categories.

### 2. Performance Metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision (per class):** Measures how many of the predicted garments were correct.
- **Recall (per class):** Measures how many actual garments were correctly classified.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 88.08%
- **Precision per class:**
  - Shirts: 79.35%
  - Trousers: 96.91%
  - Shoes: 84.44%
  - ... (remaining categories)
- **Recall per class:**
  - Shirts: 86.50%
  - Trousers: 97.50%
  - Shoes: 78.20%
  - ... (remaining categories)

## How to Use

```

## Future Improvements

- Enhance model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
- Deploy the model as a web API for real-time classification.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in the fashion industry. By automating product classification, we can improve user experience and streamline inventory management.
